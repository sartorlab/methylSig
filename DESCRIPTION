Description: MethylSig is a package for testing for
    differentially methylated cytosines (DMCs) or regions (DMRs) in
    whole-genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS) or reduced representation
    bisulfite sequencing (RRBS) experiments.  MethylSig uses a beta
    binomial model to test for significant differences between groups of
    samples. Several options exist for either site-specific or sliding
    window tests, and variance estimation.
